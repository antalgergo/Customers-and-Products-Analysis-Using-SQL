The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making.

During this project I searched for the answers for the following questions:
- Which products should we order more of or less of?
- How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
- How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
